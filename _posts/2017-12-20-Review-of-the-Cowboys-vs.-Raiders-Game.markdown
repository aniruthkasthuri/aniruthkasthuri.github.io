### Pre-Game

This was the last game of Ezekiel Elliott's 6 game suspension. However, for his return to be meaningful and to stay in the playoff race, we had to win this game. We didn't get any benefits from other contending teams as they too won earlier in the day. However, as long as we won, we were going to stay in the playoff race but with lower odds of actually getting in. The biggest concern before the game was going into O. Co Coliseum as it is one of the most hostile environments to play in.

### First Half

My father and I went to a family friend's house to watch the game. The game started out with a huge scare with a Dak Prescott interception. As all of us are huge Cowboys fans, most of us were suddenly dejected while the rest of us still had hope. Thankfully, with a 3 and out by the Raiders, we were back with the ball with the score as 0-0. After driving the ball 41 yards in 9 plays and 4:08, we were able to come away with a field goal. With another 3 and out by the Raiders, we drove down the field and scored a touchdown. Now, we started feeling confident in our Dallas Cowboys. However, with the clock winding down on the first half, the Oakland Raiders marched down the field setting themselves up for a field goal. By mere luck, the Oakland kicker Tavecchio hooked the football wide left missing the uprightsallowing us to head in to halftime with a 10-0 lead.

### Second Half

The second half of the game was more exciting than the first by a sizeable margin. With a Raiders' touchdown and another Dak Prescott interception deep on our side of the field, the momentum of the game and the moods drastically shifted. Within nine minutes of starting the second half, the game was tied at 10-10. With another 3 and out imminent, the Cowboys sent out the their special teams unit with punter Chris Jones. Catching all fans and coaches off guard, Chris Jones ran the ball for 24 yards to the Dallas 48 reinvigorating an underperforming Cowboys offense. With newfound momentum, the Cowboys scored a touchdown taking a lead of 17-10. However, within 5 minutes, the Raiders scored a touchdown to even the ball game in the 4th quarter. After exchanging 3 and outs, the Cowboys began their final march down the field. However, once more the Cowboys were stopped for a 4th & 1 at their own 40 yard line leading to one of the most interesting play if not the most interesting play of the night.

### The Index Card Ruling

The 4th & 1 was too close to call with the naked eye. Thus, the referee Gene Steratore decided to bring the chains out to measure the ball's location. However, even with the chains, Gene couldn't determine whether or not the it was a first down. As a result, he took the famous index card. This came as a complete shock to everybody from the coaches to the fans as such an event has never occurred when a ruling on the field has been made. Gene eventually ruled it a Cowboys first down. The Cowboys fans were relieved, but the Raiders were fuming from the ruling on the field. After the ruling, the Cowboys went up by one field goal 20-17 with 1:44 left in the game.

### The Fumble

On the ensuing drive, the Raiders started out strong with a 20 yard completion. However, the drive stalled with 4 consecutive incompletions. On the 4th incompletion, the Raiders were given a lifeline with a pass interference call against the Cowboys defense placing the Raiders at the Dallas 15 with 0:41 left. After the pass interference call, Cowboys fans across the US thought their playoff chances this year were doomed. Suprisingly, we were all proven incorrect in assuming that our season was over. On 3rd and 3, Derek Carr scrambled out to the Dallas 1 and lunged to score a touchdown. However, Jeff Heath tackled him short of the pylon and as he completed the tackle, Derek Carr fumbled the ball out of the endzone resulting in a touchback.

### Review

This game was entertaining down the stretch and was a rollercoaster in the last five minutes. The Cowboys moved to 8-6 while the Raiders slid to 6-8 on the season. With their season on the line, the Cowboys head home to take on the Seattle Seahawks at 3:15 PM. With Ezekiel Elliott back, the Cowboys receive a solid upgrade to their running back position making them poised to make a deep run in the playoffs should they sneak in. The Raiders, on the other hand, head to Philadelphia to battle against the Foles-led Eagles as they attempt to salvage their lost season.
